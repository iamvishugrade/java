To alter a table:

maxvalue 200;

This sequence is increment by 5 and having its initial value 100 and by incremented by 5 upto 200 that means its last value is 200;

To show the space occupied by the drive of oracle database;

1) select * from v$tablespace;

       TS# NAME                           INC BIG FLA ENC

5 rows selected.

To create a user on the system

1) create user ram
identified by r123
default tablespace users;

To show the path of stored database file of oracle database;

1) select name from v$datafile;


NAME
--------------------------------------------------------

C:\ORACLEXE\ORADATA\XE\SYSTEM.DBF
C:\ORACLEXE\ORADATA\XE\UNDO.DBF
C:\ORACLEXE\ORADATA\XE\SYSAUX.DBF
C:\ORACLEXE\ORADATA\XE\USERS.DBF

4 rows selected.

it has extension .dbf

To show the path of stored tempfile of oracle database;

1) select name from v$tempfile;

NAME
--------------------------------------------------------

C:\ORACLEXE\ORADATA\XE\TEMP.DBF

it has extension .dbf

To create tablespace

1) create tablespace acc datafile 'C:\ORACLEXE\ORADATA\XE\acc01.dbf'size 5m;

create user in a tablespace

1) create user ram1
identified by r123
default tablespace acc
quota unlimited/2m on acc;

To grant previleges to a user

1) grant create session,create table to ram1; 

Connection established by ram1

To see the all tables record from database

1)select * from tab;

create table in user ram1

1) create table emp(id number(3),name varchar2(10));

To view user table in tablespace

1) select tablespace_name from user_tables;

If a user want to do that work that is not granted to him then database will show you a error message
insufficient privileges

for example:
if user wants to create sequence seq;
though he is not granted then it will show an error message

To See the description of a table;

1) desc emp;

create another table having same datatypes of emp table

1) create table adrs(id number(3),city varchar2(10));

insert data into table adrs

1) insert into adrs values(100,'c1');

2) insert into adrs values(110,'c1');

to delete all records from a table at one time

1) delete from adrs;

To add a primary key into a table

1) alter table emp add primary key(id);

To add forgien key into a table

1) alter table adrs add foreign key(id) references emp;

Now if you want to enter a record in second table which have same datatype in the previous table which you had applied primary key.
if both of have same values of primary key with their reference table values and foreign key then it will create no problem.
but if anyone values which is not same as primary key then it will generate an error of integrity constraint violated-parent key not found
